            <Typography sx={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>When I was a kid, my family had a small stained glass window. I was obsessed with the cascading light that one little window could create.  To me, the light created a vortex, linking the outside world with the inside world. It sparked in me pure magic, love, and resource. Since I have found most of my safety lies in the divine outdoors, it was a way to always stay connected. Light is a resource.<br/>

              In college, I explored the healing art of colors. It was called Maitri. We would spend hours a day sitting in colored rooms to experience the effects of color on our psyche. The impact was undeniable as particular colors brought different moods, released emotions, physical pain and/or comfort.<br/>
              <br/>
              I find my inspiration from our magnificent mother earth. The forests, mountains, the sea - her beauty is forever inspiring. Itâ€™s my hope that my artwork brings you more beauty, magic, healing, and inspires more connection to self and others.
